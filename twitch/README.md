[Twitch.tv](www.twitch.tv) is the world's leading live streaming platform for gamers, with over 15 million daily active users. Using data to understand its users and products is one of the main responsibilities of the Twitch Science Team.

In the Data Science Path Cumulative Project, we have partnered with the [Twitch Science Team](https://science.twitch.tv/) and we were given a scrubbed dataset (800,000 rows) that describe user engagmeent with Twitch stream and Twitch chat on January 1st, 2015:

- [x] [`stream.csv`](stream.csv)  
- [x] [`chat.csv`](chat.csv)  

The `stream.csv` has the following fields:

Headers | Description |
--- | --- |
`time` | date and time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
`device_id` | device ID
`login` | login ID
`channel` | streamer name
`country` | country name abbreviation
`player` | streamed device
`game` | game name

`subscriber` | is the viewer a subscriber? (true/false)

The `chat.csv` has the following fields:
